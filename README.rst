`salt` is a mixed bag of core-util-like tools for Linux-based systems. These tools include a no-cache http-server, modified-make, file rotations, and any other core-util-like idea that seems useful.


Features
--------

- Modified-make
    Automatically calls make when a file changes.
- No-cache http-server
    A simple http-server that doesn't cache files so live updates occur on write.
- File rotations
    Rotate files in a directory to a location using alphabetical order of name.
- Color extractor
    Extract colors from an image for generating color pallettes.
- More to come

Installation
------------

Install `salt` by running:

    pip install salt
